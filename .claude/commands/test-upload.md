description: Test the document upload API endpoint
---

Help me test the document upload functionality. Create a test file and make a curl request to the upload API endpoint to verify it's working correctly.

Include:
1. Check if the API route exists at `/api/documents/upload`
2. Create a simple test text file
3. Test the upload with curl
4. Verify the response
